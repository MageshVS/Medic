    <string name="app_text">Android Studio is the official[7] integrated development environment (IDE) for Googles Android operating system, built on JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development.[8] It is available for download on Windows, macOS and Linux based operating systems.[9][10] It is a replacement for the Eclipse Android Development Tools (ADT) as the primary IDE for native Android application development.

Android Studio was announced on May 16, 2013 at the Google I/O conference. It was in early access preview stage starting from version 0.1 in May 2013, then entered beta stage starting from version 0.8 which was released in June 2014.[11] The first stable build was released in December 2014, starting from version 1.0.[12]

On May 7, 2019, Kotlin replaced Java as Googleâ€™s preferred language for Android app development.[13] Java is still supported, as is C++.[14]</string>
